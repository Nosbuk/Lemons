        <p>The lemon <span class="bold">(Citrus limon)</span> is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to Asia, primarily Northeast India (Assam), Northern Myanmar or China. The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive <span class="bold">sour taste of lemon</span> juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as <span class="bold">lemonade</span> and lemon meringue pie.</p>

          <h1>Where do Lemons began?</h1>
          <p>Our history:</p>
        </header>
        <p>The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in <span class="bold">Assam (a&nbsp;region in northeast India), northern Burma or China</span>. A genomic study of the lemon indicated it was a hybrid between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron. Lemons entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome. However, they were not widely cultivated. They were later introduced to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD. The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming, and was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens. It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region between 1000 and 1150. An article on Lemon and lime tree cultivation in Andalusia of Spain is brought down in <span class="bold">Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture</span>. The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The <span class="bold">'Bonnie Brae'</span> is oblong, smooth, thin-skinned and seedless. These are mostly grown in San Diego County, USA.</p>
        <p>The <span class="bold">'Eureka'</span> grows year-round and abundantly. This is the common supermarket lemon, also known as 'Four Seasons' (Quatre Saisons) because of its ability to produce fruit and flowers together throughout the year. This variety is also available as a plant to domestic customers. There is also a pink-fleshed Eureka lemon, with a green and yellow variegated outer skin.</p>
        <p>The <span class="bold">Lisbon lemon</span> is very similar to the Eureka and is the other common supermarket lemon. It is smoother than the Eureka, has thinner skin, and has fewer or no seeds. It generally produces more juice than the Eureka.</p>
        <p>The <span class="bold">'Femminello St. Teresa'</span>, or <span class="bold">'Sorrento'</span> is native to Italy. This fruit's zest is high in lemon oils. It is the variety traditionally used in the making of limoncello. The 'Yen Ben' is an Australasian cultivar.</p>
